                <p>our different spaces in Cairo have hosted a number of artists in residency — <br>
                    offering
                    time and room to create, experiment, and develop new work, <br>
                    connecting them with local artists and the city’s creative scene.</p>

            <p><strong>HIZZ</strong> / residency</p>
            <p class="artistName">Drummer B</p>
            <p>In 2018, Drummer B joined HIZZ’s residency program in Cairo. During this period, he collaborated with
                fellow resident artist Bashar Suleiman to produce the album <em>Pink Tape</em>. This project involved
                sampling old cassette tapes from HIZZ’s archives, blending them with contemporary beats rooted in both
                Detroit and the Middle East. The album was released on Bandcamp and was also produced as a physical pink
                cassette tape by the HIZZ team in Cairo.</p>

            <p><strong>Valley of Kings – Detroit to Cairo</strong></p>

            <p>On his subsequent visit, Drummer B worked on his solo album titled <em>Valley of Kings – Detroit to
                    Cairo</em>. This ten-track album continued the exploration of HIZZ’s cassette archives, reimagining
                lost sounds and field recordings while featuring collaborations with Detroit artists such as Pierre
                Anthony, Jon Dixon, and Umar Bin Hassan. The album was released digitally and as a limited-edition
                cassette, handcrafted by the HIZZ team.</p>

            <p><strong>Visual Work</strong></p>

            <p>During his time in Cairo, Drummer B also collaborated with Egyptian filmmaker Malak El Sawi on a music
                video that captured moments from the project. In addition, he produced a series of self-directed MPC
                beat-making videos with support from the HIZZ team — documenting his creative process in various
                locations across the city and offering a visual companion to the sonic bridge he built between Detroit
                and Cairo.</p>

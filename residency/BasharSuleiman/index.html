                    <!-- <p>Bashar Suleiman, aka lil asaf, spent extended time with us in Cairo during 2018 and
                        2019. Building,
                        experimenting, and fully merging into the city’s raw creative flow. From making beats 24
                        hours a
                        day—locked in the studio at our house, to playing late-night gigs and sharing sounds with
                        local
                        heads, Bashar became part of the rhythm of the scene.</p>
                    <p>
                        His time here was full of activity—recording sessions, beats, and collaborations with
                        Egyptian
                        artists across different styles. He shaped mixes that echoed through clubs, rooftops, and
                        underground spaces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He worked on multiple projects during that time, including Pink Tape, a 7-track LP crafted
                        with
                        American producer and DJ Drummer B, who was also staying in residency, released on our label
                        both
                        digitally and on tapes. He also released a solo EP of beats titled Throwbacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>The residency was grounded in shared space, time, and process. Bashar became part of the
                        daily
                        rhythm of
                        the house and the wider network of artists connected to it. His time here reflects the kind
                        of
                        open-ended, collaborative work we try to make possible.</p> -->
